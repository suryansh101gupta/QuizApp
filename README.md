QuizApp using Kotlin

Foloowing is a Quiz application in Android Studio using Kotlin programming language. This application is capable of storing User Profiles and login credentials using Firebase Authentication. Saves the name and score history of the user using Firebase Firestore. Also has an option of uploading profile pictures that are stored in Firebase Cloud Storage. This profile picture can be uploaded, fetched and used in app using Glide Library by Bumptech. I had to add these features using Gradle build on app level and project level.
